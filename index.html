    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p1>What's so great about combining the worlds of
         coding and cuisine? Dev Dish was founded by two 
         passionate developers who turned their love for 
         software into a culinary adventure. After years of 
         coding by day and cooking by night, they decided to 
         merge their two passions and create something 
         extraordinary.</p1>    
    <p1>Dev Dish brings a unique twist to the food truck scene, 
        offering a menu full of creative, tech-inspired dishes. 
        Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a food lover, our 
        offerings are designed to satisfy both your appetite and 
        your curiosity.</p1>
