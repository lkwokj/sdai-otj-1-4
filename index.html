    <h1>Welcome to Dev Dish Food Truck and Restaurant!</h1>

    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>What's so great about combining the worlds of
         coding and cuisine? Dev Dish was founded by two 
         passionate developers who turned their love for 
         software into a culinary adventure. After years of 
         coding by day and cooking by night, they decided to 
         merge their two passions and create something 
         extraordinary.</p>    
    <p>Dev Dish brings a unique twist to the food truck scene, 
        offering a menu full of creative, tech-inspired dishes. 
        Whether you're a tech enthusiast or a food lover, our 
        offerings are designed to satisfy both your appetite and 
        your curiosity.</p>
    <p>Dev Dish is the brainchild of Alex and Jamie, two friends 
        who met at a hackathon and discovered a shared love for 
        innovative cuisine. With a background in software development
         and a knack for culinary creativity, they embarked on a
          journey to deliver delicious, tech-themed dishes to the 
          community.</p>
